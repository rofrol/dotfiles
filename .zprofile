# What Goes to ~/.zprofile and What Goes to ~/.zshrc?
# Since ~/.zprofile is loaded only once at login time, itâ€™s best to put things that are loaded only once and can be inherited by subshells. An excellent example of this is environment variables.

# On the other hand, ~/.zshrc is typically reserved for things that are not inheritable by subshells, such as aliases and functions, custom prompts, history customizations, and so on.

# In addition, put the commands that should run every time you launch a new shell in the .zshrc file, too.
