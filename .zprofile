# What Goes to ~/.zprofile and What Goes to ~/.zshrc?
# Since ~/.zprofile is loaded only once at login time, itâ€™s best to put things that are loaded only once and can be inherited by subshells. An excellent example of this is environment variables.

# On the other hand, ~/.zshrc is typically reserved for things that are not inheritable by subshells, such as aliases and functions, custom prompts, history customizations, and so on.

# In addition, put the commands that should run every time you launch a new shell in the .zshrc file, too.

# WARNING: this should be set in ~/.zprofile, not in ~/.zshrc.
# When set in ~/.zshrc, it will be run twice or more.
# Then `brew shellenv` will return empty output,
# unless you do first `unset HOMEBREW_SHELLENV_PREFIX`

# but still some packages are keg-only like curl,
# and needs to be added to path manually like:
# export PATH="$(brew --prefix curl)/bin/":$PATH
# to find keg-only packages:
# for i in $(brew leaves --installed-on-request); do brew info $i 2>/dev/null | head -1 | grep "keg-only"; done
# unless it is installed as dependency, like `brew uses --installed curl` shows php
# in that case do `brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies curl && brew install curl`
